Rangy Updated
=============
This is a clone of Tim Down's original, and awesome range and selection JavaScript library, [Rangy](https://github.com/timdown/rangy). The original project has been abandoned for 3 years (at the time of this writing) and there are no alternative libraries that match the functionality and ease-of-use of the original Rangy.

This project is a continuation of the original Rangy project. It is starting off as a direct clone of the original Rangy and will migrate from there.

We definitely accept pull requests, and are looking for additional contributors to the project.
